 * The following code was derived by the author using the GlobalPlatform
 * Specifications as a guide to communicate with Card technologies 
 * implementing the specification.  The target version is the following
 * API specification and lower:
 * 
 *   -GlobalPlatform Card Specification v2.1.1
 *   
 * This code may or may not implement all of the features and requirements
 * defined in the specification.
 * 
 * Further, any entity contributing to code in the following package
 * (or sub-packages) of this API should be aware of GlobalPlatform's I.P.
 * disclaimers, and should not derive or contribute any code that would
 * infringe any of the I.P. that has been claimed:
 * 
 * http://globalplatform.org/specificationsipdisclaimers.asp
 * 
 * KSJava API Package: org.keysupport.globalplatform
 * 
 * All code derived in this package and sub-packages SHOULD remain
 * product agnostic, and SHOULD NOT include references to any vendors
 * nor vendor implementations.  It is entirely up to the caller of the
 * code in these packages to establish license agreements or 
 * non-disclosure agreements with vendors in order to work with a specific
 * product, and should be independent of this code base.

	 * Feedback from William C. Petty:  Get data from the ISD to form the CUID:
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 *   byte[] GET_DATA_SLCTAID = c2b("00A4040000"); 
     *   response = card.getBasicChannel().transmit(new CommandAPDU(GET_DATA_SLCTAID)); 
     *   byte[] GET_DATA_IIN = c2b("80CA004200"); 
     *   response = card.getBasicChannel().transmit(new CommandAPDU(GET_DATA_IIN));

     *   System.out.println("IIN " + new String(iinba, 2, iinba.length -2));

     *   System.out.println("CIN " + new String(cinba, 2, cinba.length -2));
     *   
     *   My notes:
     *   
     *   -Establish information on the ISD in order to determine the GP version,
     *    as well as the secure channel version.
     *   -Store the information in the GPCard object to assist with establishing the
     *    secure channel.
     *   -Standard methods should be derived in order to provide utility for injecting
     *    sensitive contents to the card, such as PUK, private keys, etc. 
     *    
     *   Challenges/Remaining questions:
     *   
     *   Some manufacturers use an Application Security Domain versus the Issuer Security
     *   domain to secure the communications during provisioning.  For example, consider
     *   the following PIV hardware:
     *   
     *   Gemalto (general):
     *   
     *   The issuer security domain is provided for lifecycle management, and the PIV
     *   admin key is used to manage the PIV application.
     *   
     *   Sensitive data is secured using the ISD secure channel using the KEK, with MACed
     *   APDUs via a secure channel.
     *   
     *   Oberthur (general):
     *   
     *   The issuer security domain is provided for lifecycle management, and the PIV
     *   admin key is used to manage the PIV application.
     *   
     *   Sensitive data is secured using and application security domain (ASD) secure 
     *   channel using the KEK, with MACed APDUs via a secure channel.
     *   
     *   This requires multiple secure channels to the card via different protocols
     *   which are dependent on Card Management verus Application Management.
